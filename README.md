# Django-API
Django Web Framework API for managing users activity.
The tools used for this project:
	1. Raspberry Pi 1 Model B
	2. Apache2 web server
	3. Django 1.10
	4. Python 3
	5. Bootstrap library
	To host the API I set up an Apache2 server on a Linux based system (Raspberry Pi). 
  The language used to create the API is Python, because Django is a Python-based web framework. 
  I also used Bootstrap library to slightly modify buttons and templates design.
